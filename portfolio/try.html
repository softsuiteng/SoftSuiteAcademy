Engineering cool ideas is where my passion lies. You can find a full list of my projects here. I'm also a writer and I write lots and lots of poetry, check out my books here. And oh yeah I give people demos too check em out.

I write blog posts about open-source, coding and basically anything that interests me in tech. And I post videos to youtube too.

Outside programming, I enjoy baking, watching anime, obessing over football and my favorite gaming and chess too in case you're one of those that do not consider chess gaming.
